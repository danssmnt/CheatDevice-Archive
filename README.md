This project aims to fully archive **Edison Carterâ€™s Cheat Device** for _Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories_ and _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories_.

This is a **Work in Progress**.

## What, why and how?
**Cheat Device** was one of the first homebrews ever made for the _PlayStation: Portable_ (running on firmware 2.01, 2.5 and 2.6), developed between 2005 and 2007. 

**Cheat Device** is, in a nutshell, a cheat menu for _Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories_ and _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories_, created by the popular modder _**Edison Carter**_. 
It was very famous back in the day, even allowing you to create your own cheats (with Cheat Maker)! It was certainly one of the most influential _PlayStation: Portable_ homebrews ever and part of my childhood!

This project was started by me ([@danssmnt](https://github.com/danssmnt)), with the help of some OG CheatDevice members, as a way to preserve an almost 20 year old homebrew. 
Even with the popularity back then, **Cheat Device** has been slowly dying over time, with more and more content being removed and taken down from the internet, so, I decided it was best to try and preserve most of **Cheat Device** history before it was lost for good.

This archive was made by scouring old websites (with **[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)**) and GTA forums from back in the day.

## UserCheats
We're trying to archive all **UserCheats** made for **Cheat Device** too!
Most of them come from _CheatSync_ backups made by the community!

> [!WARNING]
> All usercheats are **UNTESTED** and can crash your game.
> Also it is recommended to use them in the latest releases of **Cheat Device**.
