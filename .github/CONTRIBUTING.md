# How can I contribute?
There's lots of ways to help us on our objective:
 1. Spread this project to the _PlayStation: Portable_ community (Reddit, Forums, Discord servers...)!
 2. Scour your childhood _PlayStation: Portable_ for that **Cheat Device** you remember playing back in the day!
 3. Also scour your childhood _PlayStation: Portable_ for interesting unarchived UserCheats, maybe you even made your own!
 4. Scour the internet (**[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)** may be useful) for more **Cheat Device** versions and content!
 5. Test all archived **Cheat Device** versions and UserCheats!
 6. If you wanna go even further and have a good understanding of _PlayStation: Portable_ Programming (C Language, MIPS Assembly), how about helping decompile **Cheat Device**?
 7. If you have more inside knowledge from back then, don't be afraid to tell us!
 
If you have done any of these, don't be afraid to open a pull request or an issue!
