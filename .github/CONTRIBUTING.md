# How can I contribute?
There's lots of ways to help us on our objective:
 1. Spread this project to the PSP community (reddit, forums, discord servers...)!
 2. Scour your childhood PSP for that Cheat Device you remember playing back in the day!
 3. Also scour your childhood PSP for interesting unarchived usercheats, maybe you even made your own!
 4. Scour the internet (**[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)** may be useful) for more Cheat Device versions and content!
 5. Test all archived Cheat Device versions and usercheats!
 6. If you wanna go even further and have a good understanding of PSP Programming (C Language, MIPS Assembly), how about decompiling Cheat Device?
 7. If you have more inside knowledge from back then, don't be afraid to tell us!
 
If you have done any of these, don't be afraid to open a pull request or an issue!
