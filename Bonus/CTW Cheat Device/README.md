## Archival Notes
Made by **_qwikrazor87_**.

For those who don't know, **_qwikrazor87_** was a legend of the PSP / Vita Homebrew Scene and even created the well known "npdrm_free" plugin.
He passed away 3 years ago, but his legacy still continues to live on.
I decided to archive this so people would never forget about him.

Rest In Peace **_qwikrazor87_** <3
