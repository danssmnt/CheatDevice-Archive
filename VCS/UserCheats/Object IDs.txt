I realized that 
1d50-1d6d more business buildings (full buildings, more detailed than the first set)
are the buildings after they've been attacked i.e. cracked walls, dented garage doors, hanging fixtures.
and the set I posted above
1d09-1d0d business building in good condition
are the buildings while they're in good condition.

also 1ce7 large green door has a decent amount of thickness to it, and is pretty big. but far more rectangular than the object used in LCS.
