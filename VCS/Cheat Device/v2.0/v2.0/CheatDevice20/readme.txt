CheatDevice v2.0 for GTA Vice City Stories
By Edison Carter


To install:

 copy vcscheatdevice.prx X:\dh\kd

  (replace X: with the drive letter of your PSP)

 edit this file:

  X:\dh\271\flash0\kd\pspbtcnf_game.txt

   (replace 271 with any other emulated firmware versions you want to use, such as 260, 250, 200)

 and add the line

  ms0:/dh/kd/vcscheatdevice.prx

 after the line

  ms0:/dh/kd/devhook.prx

IMPORTANT NOTE: After installing, wait at least 30 seconds before turning
off USB or pulling out your memory stick.  The PC caches your changes and
doesn't write them out until a while later.  If your memory card gets
corrupt, use chkdsk /f X:

Disclaimer: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I advise against saving your game
after using cheats.  Please note that when you spawn vehicles, you are
using a game cheat that will lower your criminal rating!

Thanks to ADePSP for the installer!
