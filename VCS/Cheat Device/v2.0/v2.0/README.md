## Release Notes
> Thanks to ADePSP for the installer!

> You need to run VCS through DevHook to use this. Look here for more info on that. You can install the PRX by running the installer, or read the instructions in readme.txt if you prefer to do it by hand.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: After installing, wait at least 30 seconds before turning off USB or pulling out your memory stick. The PC caches your changes and doesn't write them out until a while later. If your memory card gets corrupt, use chkdsk /f X:

> I advise against saving your game after using cheats. Please note that when you spawn vehicles, you are using a game cheat that will lower your criminal rating!
