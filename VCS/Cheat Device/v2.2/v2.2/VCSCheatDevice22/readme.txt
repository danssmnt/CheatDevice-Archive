VCS CheatDevice v2.2 for GTA Vice City Stories
By Edison Carter

To install, run CheatDeviceInstall.exe, or to install manually:

 mkdir X:\dh\kd
 copy vcscheatdevice.prx X:\dh\kd

  (replace X: with the drive letter of your PSP)

 edit one of these files:

  for emulated FW 2.71 edit: X:\dh\271\flash0\kd\pspbtcnf_game.txt
  for emulated FW 2.82 edit: X:\dh\282\f0\kd\pspbtcnf_game_dh.txt
  for emulated FW 3.01 edit: X:\dh\301\f0\kd\pspbtcnf_game_dh.txt

 and add the line

  ms0:/dh/kd/vcscheatdevice.prx

 after the line that look like:

  ms0:/dh/kd/devhook.prx
  or
  /kd/devhook.prx #DEVHOOK


IMPORTANT NOTE: After installing, wait at least 15 seconds before turning
off USB or pulling out your memory stick.  The PC caches your changes and
doesn't write them out until a while later.  If your memory card gets
corrupt, use chkdsk /f X:

Disclaimer: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I advise against saving your game
after using cheats.  Please note that when you spawn vehicles, you are
using a game cheat that will lower your criminal rating!

Thanks to:
ADePSP for the installer!
vettefan for finding the place marker and no visible car damage and sideways tires
winchy for radar and hud flags
