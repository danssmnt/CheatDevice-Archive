Programming for CheatDevice
---------------------------

Cheats can be added to CheatDevice by creating text files in the
/cheats/vcs directory on the memory card.  The language is a simplified
interpreted subset of C.

Commands: (case sensitive)

  #cheat Cheat Title
  #off
  // comments
  setchar(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  sethex(startaddress, hexintvalue, ...;
  setshort(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  setint(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  setfloat(startaddress, floatvalue, ...);
  teleport(x, y, z);
  off();

Formats for numeric constants:

  decimal:    123
  hex:        0xABCF0 or 0xabcf0
  binary:     0b00100101101
  float:      1.23
  character:  'a', 'b', 'c', '\n'

Special pointer constants:

  pplayer:   Pointer to player object.
  pcar:      Pointer to player's car object.  Any command that uses this
               only executes when the player is in a car.
  pobj:      Pointer to player object if on foot, or player's car object
               if in a vehicle.

Some examples:

  // any comments, such as author credits
  #cheat Teleport: Top of Tall Building
  teleport(95, -1509, 216.98);

  #cheat Hud On
  setchar(0x09a63418, 1);

  #cheat Hud Off
  setchar(0x09a63418, 0);

  #cheat Max Money
  setint(0x08bde55c, 99999999);
  setint(0x08bde55c, 99999999);

Functions with "..." can write any number of values starting at the given
address, so Max Money could also be written as:

  #cheat Max Money
  setint(0x08bde55c, 99999999, 99999999);

  #cheat No Money
  setint(0x08bde55c, 0, 0);

  #cheat Time is 9:30am
  setchar(0x08bb3b40, 9, 30);

The #off section is used to set a value back to its normal setting and is
executed a single time when a cheat is turned off.  For example:

  // by winchy
  #cheat Invisible Vic
  setchar(pplayer + 0x4C, 0x10, 0x20);
  #off
  setchar(pplayer + 0x4C, 0, 0);

  // by chrislawrance
  #cheat Lock Camera
  setchar(pplayer + 0x550, 1);
  #off
  setchar(pplayer + 0x550, 0);

Integer values can be treated as signed or unsigned.  All of the following
commands set the same value:

  setchar(0x08bde55c, 255);
  setchar(0x08bde55c, -1);
  setchar(0x08bde55c, 0xff);
  setchar(0x08bde55c, 0xFF);
  setchar(0x08bde55c, 0b11111111);
  sethex(0x08bde55c, ff);

sethex is just a version of setchar that assumes all values are hex so you
can leave off the 0x.

Cheat Maker automatically performs region conversion behind the scenes
so users of the EU version see the same addresses as the US version and
addresses entered are automatically converted to the correct region.
There is no need to give different versions of cheats for EU and US
versions of the game.


CheatDevice 2.0 Advanced Features
---------------------------------

The language has been extended to include much of the C syntax.  Most
operators and some of the main keywords are supported.  Although loops are
supported, be careful with them, as they make it very easy to slow down
the game too much.

Keywords:

  if else for while break continue true false pi { }

Operators:

  , = += -= *= /= %= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= ?: || &&
  | ^ & == != < > <= >= << >> + - * / % & ! ~ ++ -- ( )

Stdlib functions:

  abs, fabs, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, rand,
  memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp,
  strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat,
  strcmp, strncmp, strchr, strrchr, strlen

New functions:

  getchar(address);
  getshort(address);
  getint(address);
  getfloat(address);
  min(value, ...);
  max(value, ...);
  sgn(value);
  int(value);

Button variables:

  buttons      - the current button state
  press        - the button state once when first pressed, otherwise 0
  pressslow    - button press with slow auto-repeat
  pressmed     - button press with medium auto-repeat
  pressfast    - button press with fast auto-repeat
  xstick       - the position of the analog stick from -1.0 to 1.0
  ystick       - the position of the analog stick from -1.0 to 1.0

Button mask constants:

  CTRL_SELECT     CTRL_LTRIGGER     CTRL_HOME
  CTRL_START      CTRL_RTRIGGER     CTRL_VOLUP
  CTRL_UP         CTRL_TRIANGLE     CTRL_VOLDOWN
  CTRL_RIGHT      CTRL_CIRCLE       CTRL_SCREEN
  CTRL_DOWN       CTRL_CROSS        CTRL_NOTE
  CTRL_LEFT       CTRL_SQUARE

To keep it simple, there are no user defined functions, no *dereference
or &reference, and variables are not strongly typed.  All variables have
global scope within their cheat section.

New variables are automatically declared and created by the "=" operator.
If you need to declare a variable without assigning to it, declare it as
static i.e. "static varname;" and its initial value will be zero.

Examples:

  setint(pcar + 0x123, getint(pcar + 0x123) + 1);

  p1 = 0x08901234;
  setchar(p1, getchar(p1) + 1); // increment
  setchar(p1, getchar(p1) & 0xFE); // clear a bit
  setchar(p1, getchar(p1) ^ 0x02); // flip a bit
  setchar(p1, getchar(p1) | 0x08); // set a bit
  setchar(p1, getchar(p1) | 0b00001000); // set a bit could also be done this way

  static fInit;
  if (!fInit)
  {
     fInit = true;
     // anything here runs just once
  }

  #cheat Rocket Boost 4
  if (buttons & CTRL_CROSS)
  {
     boost = 4.0;
     thrust = boost * 0.00333;

     // velocity = velocity + forward vector * thrust
     setfloat(pcar + 0x0140, getfloat(pcar + 0x0140) + getfloat(pcar + 0x0010) * thrust);
     setfloat(pcar + 0x0144, getfloat(pcar + 0x0144) + getfloat(pcar + 0x0014) * thrust);
     setfloat(pcar + 0x0148, getfloat(pcar + 0x0148) + getfloat(pcar + 0x0018) * thrust);

     // rotational control
     setfloat(pcar + 0x0078, -0.03 * xstick);
  }
