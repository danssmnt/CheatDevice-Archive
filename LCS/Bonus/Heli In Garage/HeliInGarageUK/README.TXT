This is a save file for the UK version of GTA Liberty City Stories with a
Police Maverick in the Staunton garage.  It replaces the first save on the card.

It looks like it's easier to get it out of the garage with a car.  Before opening
the garage door, go out to the street and get a car.  Get the PCJ out of the
garage and park the car in the back behind the helicopter, then turn the heli's
tail to one side with your head.  Get in the car and push it out.

Installation: unzip this archive to your memory card.  This should put the
files in the directory PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10041S0.
