# LCS Cheat Device v1.0h

## Release Date
???
 
## Archival Notes
@danssmnt: I'm 99% sure this has never existed, but, if you look at the links under the cheatdevice website, there's a "LCSCheatDevice10hPRX" there, probably just a fake link though: [Wayback Machine CheatDevice](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cheatdevice.com*).

But, because I can't 100% confirm it never existed, I won't remove it from the list of Cheat Device's to archive.

> [!NOTE]
> This version is unarchived, if it even exists...

If anyone has more info about it, feel free to share it!
