## Release Date
???
 
## Archival Notes
danssmnt: I'm 99% sure this has never existed, but, if you look at the links under the cheatdevice website, there's a "LCSCheatDevice10hPRX" there, probably just a hoax tho: [Wayback Machine CheatDevice](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cheatdevice.com*).
