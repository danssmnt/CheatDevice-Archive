Unzip the archive to your memory card so the files go in
PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10041S0.  This replaces the first save on the card.

To start CheatDevice, simply load it like a saved game.  You can then load
your own saved game if you want.

Disclaimer: THIS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
USE 333MHz AT YOUR OWN RISK!
