## Release Notes
> Please try to limit your use of the large video recorder. The videos generated are huge to download. For technical reasons, it is not possible to display the instructions during full screen video recording without the possibility of it getting into the video, so you'll just have to remember that X+DOWN stops the recording.

> RCGOBLI, RCRAIDE, RCBANDT and "tiny invisible heli" are all drivable now thanks to Vettefan. If you take the invisible heli to a pay 'n spray, it'll become visible and you can see it's the police heli that chases you when you have 3 stars.
