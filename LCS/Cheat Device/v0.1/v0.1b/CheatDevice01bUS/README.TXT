CheatDevice v0.1b for GTA:Liberty City Stories
by Edison Carter

Infinite health, set wanted level, set time, set weather, spawn anything!

Unzip the archive to your memory card so the files go in
PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10041S0.  This replaces the first save on the card.

To start CheatDevice, simply load it like a saved game.  You can then load
another game save if you want and it'll stay in memory.

Do not load CheatDevice again when it's already running!  Your game will
probably crash!

Disclaimer: THIS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME, SO USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Don't
use this for doing missions or when you're planning to save your game.
