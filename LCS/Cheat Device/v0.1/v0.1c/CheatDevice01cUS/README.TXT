CheatDevice v0.1c for GTA:Liberty City Stories
by Edison Carter

Infinite health, edit wanted level, edit time, edit weather, spawn anything!

v0.1c adds more weather choices and support for firmware 2.5.

Unzip the archive to your memory card so the files go in
PSP/SAVEDATA/ULUS10041S0.  This replaces the first save on the card.

To start CheatDevice, simply load it like a saved game.  You can then load
another save if you want and it'll stay in memory.

Disclaimer: THIS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Some of the spawn choices like the RC toys and boats will crash the game.
Don't save your game after using this.
