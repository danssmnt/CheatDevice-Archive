## Release Notes
> This version lets you change your CPU speed between 222MHz and 333MHz. You can also see your battery level, voltage and temp. This feature is not available on firmware 2.6 yet. The syscalls are all mixed up on 2.6 and it would be prohibitively difficult to discover the CPU and battery stuff on 2.6. Of course the battery life will be shorter if you play at 333MHz.

> Video Recorder records an animated GIF at 8 frames per second. I think it may actually be better to stay at 222MHz for video recording. The CPU time starvation on 222MHz helps slow down the game and hold the screen still during the screen captures.

> Don't forget to press DOWN+X to stop your video before taking the memory card out!

> The GIF file generated is uncompressed. To compress it, load it into anything that can load animated GIFs and then save. Compression reduces the filesize by better than 50%. Always compress the GIF before posting on the web, and limit the length of your recordings to keep the size reasonable!

> The Heavy Bike cheat determines the mass of motorcycles when they are first created, like when you open the garage or when you first see one in traffic, so you need to turn it on before opening the garage or finding a motorcycle you want to ride. Once a motorcycle is created, its mass property is set. Other motorcycles on the road will also be heavy, but for peds, their motorcycles burst into flames at the slightest touch of another vehicle. If you don't want this, get yourself a heavy motorcycle then turn the cheat off so new motorcycles will be normal.

> With this cheat, you are the heaviest thing in the universe and in every collision, the other vehicle has to do all the moving to get out of the way. If you shove a car into a wall, it has nowhere else to go so it'll squirt up into the air like the Yardie Lobo in my video.

> If you don't turn on Your Car Is Indestructible, you get a cool flame effect when you crash into walls.
