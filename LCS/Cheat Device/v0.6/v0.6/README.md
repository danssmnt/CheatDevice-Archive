# LCS Cheat Device v0.6

## Release Date
28 dec. 2005

## Changelog
 - Flyable Dodo with thrust
 - Video recorder is a little faster

## Release Notes
> I left the Dodo more realistic. If you pull back too much on the stick, it'll stall and descend. Like a real plane of this type, you can't climb too much too fast without losing too much speed. I think this was the amount of power they intended it to have because with more thrust it has a bad noseclimb problem.

> I made some more optimizations to the video recorder. It's a little faster now.
