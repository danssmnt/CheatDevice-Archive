Programming for CheatDevice

Cheats can be added to CheatDevice by creating text files in the cheats
directory on the memory card.  Although the syntax looks like C, it's not C.
None of the C operators and keywords are implemented except + and - and
what's listed below.

Commands: (case sensitive)

  #cheat Cheat Title
  #off
  // comments
  setchar(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  sethex(startaddress, hexintvalue, ...;
  setshort(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  setint(startaddress, intvalue, ...);
  setfloat(startaddress, floatvalue, ...);
  teleport(x, y, z);

Formats for numeric constants:

  decimal:    123
  hex:        0xABCF0 or 0xabcf0
  binary:     0b00100101101
  float:      1.23
  character:  'a', 'b', 'c', '\n'
  addresses must be hex

Special pointer constants:

  pplayer:   Pointer to player object.
  pcar:      Pointer to player's car object.  Any command that uses this
               only executes when the player is in a car.
  pobj:      Pointer to player object if on foot, or player's car object
               if in a vehicle.

Some examples:

  // any comments, such as author credits
  #cheat Teleport: Top of Tall Building
  teleport(95, -1509, 216.98);

  #cheat Hud On
  setchar(0x08b59b0a, 1);

  #cheat Hud Off
  setchar(0x08b59b0a, 0);

  #cheat Max Money
  setint(0x08b89acc, 99999999);
  setint(0x08b89ad0, 99999999);

Functions with "..." can write any number of values starting at the given
address, so Max Money could also be written as:

  #cheat Max Money
  setint(0x08b89acc, 99999999, 99999999);

  #cheat No Money
  setint(0x08b89acc, 0, 0);

  #cheat Time is 9:30am
  setchar(0x08b5e090, 9, 30);

The #off section is used to set a value back to its normal setting and is
executed a single time when a cheat is turned off.  For example:

  // by vettefan
  #cheat Invisible Toni
  setchar(pplayer + 0x19A, 0xE2);
  #off
  setchar(pplayer + 0x19A, 0x02);

  // by chrislawrance
  #cheat Lock Camera
  setchar(pplayer + 0x560, 1);
  #off
  setchar(pplayer + 0x560, 0);

Integer values can be treated as signed or unsigned.  All of the following
commands set the same value:

  setchar(0x08b89acc, 255);
  setchar(0x08b89acc, -1);
  setchar(0x08b89acc, 0xff);
  setchar(0x08b89acc, 0xFF);
  setchar(0x08b89acc, 0b11111111);
  sethex(0x08b89acc, ff);

sethex is just a version of setchar that assumes all values are hex so you
can leave off the 0x.

Cheat Maker automatically performs region conversion behind the scenes
so users of the UK version see the same addresses as the US version and
addresses entered are automatically converted to the correct region.
There is no need to give different versions of cheats for UK and US
versions of the game.
