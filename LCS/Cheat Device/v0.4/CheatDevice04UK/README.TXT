CheatDevice v0.4 for GTA:Liberty City Stories
by Edison Carter

v0.1: Infinite health, edit wanted level, edit time, edit weather, snow,
         spawn anything, display coordinates and speed.
v0.2: Teleport, step through walls, power jump.
v0.3: Screenshot, edit car colors, never fall off your bike.
v0.4: Your car is indescructible, or always steaming, smoking, or on fire,
         no reload, firmware 2.6 support.

For firmware 2.0, 2.01, 2.5 and 2.6.

Note: On firmware 2.5, CheatDevice may crash if it autoloads while the game
is booting.  You'll need to have another newer save for it to autoload, or
boot with the memory card out, then load CheatDevice from the menu.

Unzip the archive to your memory card so the files go in
PSP/SAVEDATA/ULES00151S0.  This replaces the first save on the card.

To start CheatDevice, simply load it like a saved game.  You can then load
another save if you want and it'll stay in memory.

Disclaimer: THIS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Some of the spawn choices like the RC toys and boats will crash the game.
Don't save your game after using this.
